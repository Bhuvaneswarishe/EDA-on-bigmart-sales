# EDA-on-bigmart-sales
analysing the bigmart sales data on different aspects
Big Mart's data scientists collected sales data for 1559 commodities across 10 locations in
various cities during 2013. Additionally, specific characteristics of each product and retailer were
identified. This notebook will undertake data pre-processing and feature engineering to ensure
the dataset is ready for use by the machine learning model. Additionally, this notebook will
involve initial data exploration, EDA, and some hypothesis testing. These steps ensure a
thorough understanding of the data and its nuances before applying it to the machine-learning
model.
